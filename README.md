    version 1.0 - Currently working only from Celsius unit. There is a bug which does not allow conversion between all units of temperature. Commented out in GUI.java, if you have any idea or advice, feel free to add your changes and send a push request.   

    version 2.0 - Bug fixed, fully operational. You can now convert between all units no matter which unit of temperature to start from.
